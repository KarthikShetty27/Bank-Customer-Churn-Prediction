# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn refers to the loss of existing clients or customers. In this project I have created a ANN (artificial neural network) model that will predict if the customer (or clients) will continue or discontinue to be the customer of that bank.

The input values for our ANN model to predict if the customer will leave the bank:
```
* Geography
* Credit Score
* Gender
* Age 
* Tenure
* Balance
* Number of Products
* Does this customer have a credit card?
* Is this customer an Active Member?
* Estimated Salary
```
The output value will be a boolean value.
